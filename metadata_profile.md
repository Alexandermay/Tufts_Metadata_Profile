# Tufts MIRA Metadata Application Profile
| UI Label | Attribute Name | Predicate | Type | Cardinality | Defintion | Guidelines | Example | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Abstract | abstract | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.abstract | string | multiple |A refinement of the description element, this element is used as a brief summary of the resource. | Repeatable only if abstract contains different languages. If descriptions are in different languages (including abstracts), the property should be repeated with language tags. | `Abstract:` Widespread concern that voter identification laws suppress turnout amongracial and ethnic minorities has made empirical evaluations of these laws crucial. . . . |Abstracts from self-submission deposits of theses and scholarship go into the description element, not abstract. Consequently, theses should migrate descriptions to abstract. For Tisch created content, this is mapped from the following: the `MARC 520` field, the Proquest `DISS_abstract element`, the Springer `AbstractSection[@ID]/Heading` element, and the first string in the `Description` column for an Excel based ingest.|
| Admin Set | *n/a* | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.admin_set_member | URI | `singular` |An administrative grouping of items that an administrative unit is ultimately responsible for managing. The set itself helps to manage the items within it. | | | |
| Alternative Title | alternative_title | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.alternative | string | multiple |An alternative name for the resource.|Alternative is a property that refers to a name or names of a resource used as a substitute or alternative to the formal title. These are secondary titles, abbreviations, translations of a title, etc. Overly long descriptive elements should go into the “Description element.” |`Alternate Title:` Passion for Pulses. A Feast of Beans, Peas and Lentils from Around the World. Enter: A Feast of Beans, Peas and Lentils from Around the World |Typically alternative is used for secondary titles. For Tisch created content this is mapped from the following: all `MARC 246` elements, and the Excel `Alternative_Title` heading. |
| Bibliographic Citation | bibliographic_citation | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.bibliographicCitation | string | multiple | A bibliographic reference for the resource--the preferred citation.| The recommended property to describe the bibliographic citation information for a resource within its own metadata. This is an element refinement of dc:identifier, defined in the 'dcterms' namespace. The value of this property would hold details of the bibliographic item that contains the resource along with the position of the resource within it.| `Bibliographic Citation:` Hammer, David. "Challenges and Possibilities of Meaningful Assessment in Large Lecture Introductory Physics." Background Paper for the National Study of Education in Undergraduate Science, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, 2012. |Thus for a journal article it could capture the journal title, volume and issue numbers, pagination and publication date, or for a book chapter the book details and pagination. Other details of the resource, such as its title and creators, will be described using the usual Dublin Core properties. Optionally, but redundantly, these details may be included in the citation as well.  For more informatition see the [Dublin Core citation guidelines](http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/). Tisch creates this element for Excel based ingests via the `Bibliographic_Citation` column. |
| Contributor | contributor | ::RDF::Vocab::DC11.contributor | string | multiple | The name of a corporate entity related to the resource. | An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource. Examples of a Contributor include a person, an organization, or a service. The authorized headings in order of preference are the Library of Congress and then VIAF. If there is not an authorized heading, personal names should be grouped in family name as one part of the name and forename as the other part. Divide with commas, ie, Student, Jane. When you in doubt about family name and given name, give the name as it appears.contributor: Snoop Dogg. If there is more than one contributor/creator/publisher/rightsHolder, each should be listed separately.| `Contributor:` Parnell, Andrew C. |Tisch interprets this field as an added entry, and as a result, for Tisch created content it is mapped from all `MARC 7xx` fields, and the `Contributor` column in Excel based ingests. |
| Corporate Name | corporate_name | ::RDF::Vocab::MADS.CorporateName | string | multiple |A corporate name used as a subject access point. | It is a Tufts locally typed field that maps most closely to the `MARC 610` field. |`Corporate Name:` Tufts University. Department of Biology. | For Tisch created content it is mapped from all `MARC 610` fields, and the `CorpName` column in Excel based ingests.  As local practice Tufts University also uses it to establish departments for theses and disertations.  As such, it is mapped from the Proquest `//DISS_inst_contact[1]` to a controlled vocabulary established by the Cataloging Unit. |
| Created By | created_by | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.createdby | string | multiple |A meaningful string to indicate if a system or process outside Fedora, rather than an individual, created the metadata record and/or initiated the ingest process.| Auto-generated by a system or transformative tool rather than a person. UTLN for the person creating the metadata record.|`Created By:` selfdep; CIDER; ArchivesSpace; externalXSLT | |
| Creator | creator | ::RDF::Vocab::DC11.creator | string | multiple |An entity primarily responsible for making the resource. | At Tufts we are using this DC element to indicate the creator of the original work, not the creator of the digitized item. Consequently, examples of a “Creator” include a person, an organization, or a service and are the functional equivalent to an author and/or primary illustrator in the bibliographic world. Creator’s should conform with Library of Congress Name Authorities when available. If not available, use "Lastname, Firstname"  to create a heading. Contact Tisch Cataloging if NACO work is desired. Do not add realator terms. If it is considered important, give a brief description about the creator’s role in the description. |`Creator:` Verard, Antoine, d. ca. 1513. | For Tisch created content, this is mapped from the following: the `MARC 1xx` field, the Proquest `//DISS_author`, the Springer `//Author` element, and the `Creator` column for an Excel based ingest. |
| Creator department | creator_dept | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.creatordept | string | multiple | An internal note indicating the correlation between a scholarship submission and their appropriate department. | A string of numbers auto-generated by a Hydra-tool to indicate which archival collection and series a piece of scholarship should be added to.|`Creator Department:` UA005.010 | Per DD tool: "The self-submission tool auto-generates this number for all Undergraduate Honors Theses submissions to be used by DCA staff when importing metadata back into CIDER."|
| Date Accepted | date_accepted | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.dateAccepted | string | multiple | Date user-submitted resource is accepted. | ISO compliant. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 |`Date Accepted:` 2018-10-24 | |
| Date Available | date_available | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.available | string | multiple | Date user-submitted resource is available. | ISO compliant. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 |`Date Available:` 2018-10-24 | |
| Date Copyrighted | date_copyrighted | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.dateCopyrighted | string | multiple | Date of copyright. | ISO compliant. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 |`Date Copyrighted:` 2018-10-24 | |
| Date Created | date_created | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.created | string | multiple | Date of creation of object in the repository. | ISO compliant. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 | 2018-10-24 | |
| Date Issued | date_issued | ::RDF::Vocab::EBUCore.dateIssued | string | multiple | The date the resource was pushed to production in the repository.  That is, date of formal issuance (e.g., publication) of the resource. | ISO compliant. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 |`Date Issued:` 2018-10-24 | |
| Depositor | depositor | ::RDF::Vocab::relators.dpt | string | `singular` | Person who deposits a work in the repository. | Created automatically on ingest according to user's login or by name of machine process (migration). | `Depositor:` amay02 | Does not export as part of metadata.|
| Description | description | ::RDF::Vocab::DC11.description | string | multiple |A description of the resource. Description may include but is not limited to a free-text account of the resource. Use AACR2, DCRM(b), CCO, AAT, DACS or other content standards as appropriate to assist in creating the free text.| The description is a potentially rich source of indexable terms and assist the users in their selection of an appropriate resource. To refine the character of a description use abstract or tableOfContent. | `Description:` 80 pages and 4 color plates. | Tisch maps all 5xx (except the 520) from MARC, the description collumn from the spreadsheet ingest, |
| Displays in Portal | displays_in | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.displays_in | [controlled](displays.yml) | multiple | A controlled vocabulary of where the object can be displayed. See: [controlled](displays.yml) | Other hydra heads look for this element as part of their access functionality.  OAI-PMH is generated if object's `displays` is set to "DL" | dl | This is a required element.  Choose `nowhere` if you do not want the object displayed. |
| Embargo Note | embargo_note | ::RDF::Vocab:: premis.TermOfRestriction | string | `singluar` | An internal, and local, note for administrative purposes indicating whether the resource is under embargo. | Free text string for indicaticting the terms of embargo | `Embargo Note:` Item is under embargo. |At Tisch, this information is typically acquired by the Digital Collection Librarian.| 
| End Date | end_date | ::RDF::Vocab::PREMIS.hasEndDate | string | `singluar` |An administrative note indicating the last day the item is under embargo.  | ISO compliant. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 |`End Date:` 2018-10-24 | At Tisch, this information is typically acquired by the Digital Collection Librarian and entered in an Excel based ingest under the `Embargo` collumn.  It is also mapped from ProQuest: `replace(/DISS_submission/DISS_restriction/DISS_sales_restriction/@remove, '(\d{2})/(\d{2})/((\d{4}))', '$3-$1-$2')`| 
| Extent | extent | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.extent | string | `singluar` | | | | | 
| Format | format_label | ::RDF::Vocab::PREMIS.hasFormatName | string | multiple | | | | |
| Funder | funder | ::RDF::Vocab::relators.fnd | string | multiple | A free floating text field to describe who funded the project that made the resouce. | | | |
| Genre | genre | ::RDF::Vocab::MADS.GenreForm | string | multiple | A distinctive type of literary or artistic materials, usually characterized by style or function rather than subject, physical characteristics, or form. | Recommended best practice is to use the controlled vocabulary from Getty for Trove or the RBMS controlled vocabularies for rare books.| `Genre:` Correspondence; Diaries | Tisch uses this element exclusively for Trove and rare books catalogued according to DCRM(b). It is mapped from the following: the `MARC 655` field and the `Genre` column in Excel.|
| Held By | held_by | ::RDF::Vocab::Bibframe.heldBy | string | multiple | Entity holding the item or from which it is available.| | | |
| Ingested<sup>[1](#system-dates)</sup> | date_uploaded | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.dateSubmitted | dateTime | `single` |Date user submitted a resource. Generated automatically. | ISO compliant. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 |`Ingested:` 2018-10-24 | System automatically generates and is uneditable.|
| Internal Note | internal_note | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.internal_note | string | multiple |A free text field for the metadata author to fill out as needed. May be used to track XSLT templates used in producing the metadata and the date that the XSLT was run to create the XML. In Fedora 3 it is in the  `ac:comment` field. | Provide enough information to be useful for all repository workers.|`Internal Note:` Original file name: 178-02.pdf  | |
| Is Part Of | is_part_of | ::RDF::Vocab::DC::isPartOf | string | multiple |A related resource in which the described resource is physically or logically included. |Currently Tisch Library uses a series like phrase that groups like items together.|`Is Part Of:` Digitized Books & Manuscripts. |Tisch automatically generates these based on the process that touches the ingested item.  For Excel based ingests the toolkit inserts a process based on user input, i.e. if the user selects Faculty Scholarship from the [RepoToolkit](https://github.com/Alexandermay/RepoToolKit_NG), the result is: `Process[contains(text(), 'Faculty’)]”= isPartOf: Tufts University faculty scholarship` |
| Is Replaced By | is_replaced_by | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.isReplacedBy | string | multiple | | | | Tisch is in favor of using `Replaces` instead.  I'm unsure we have used this for any objects.|
| Language | language | ::RDF::Vocab::DC11.language | string | multiple | Language of the resource. | Use a controlled vocabulary like the MARC langue codes: http://id.loc.gov/search/?q=&q=cs%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fid.loc.gov%2Fvocabulary%2Flanguages | `Language:` eng |Tisch currently maps this for digitized books from the `008` field, and thefore requires the use of a regEx : `.//controlfield[@tag = '008']/replace(., '.*?\s\d\s|.{2}$', ''))`   |
| Legacy PID | legacy_pid | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.legacy_pid | string | `singluar` |Identifider previously used in Fedora 3 to identify a digital object. | Transferred from Fedora 3; new items will not have a legacy PID.  A unique string of alphanumeric characters with the prefix "tufts:". Certain collections of digital objects will have differing patterns of alphanumeric characters and identifying characteristics. DCA best practice was to match the PID to object id. Tisch best practice was to have MIRA auto-generate a string. | tufts:UA069.001.DO.MS001; tufts:12345 |`Should this be uneditable?` |
| License | license | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.rights|string | multiple | A legal document giving official permission to do something with the resource. | A free text field. | `License:` In the public domain due to date published.| |
| Modified<sup>[1](#system-dates)</sup> | date_modified | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.modified | dateTime | multiple | | | | |
| Personal Name | personal_name | ::RDF::Vocab::MADS.PersonalName | string | multiple | Subject headings for personal names related to the resource. | Use Library of Congress Name Authorities in creating this access point. | `Personal Name:` Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 -- Stage history -- To 1625. | MADS as an ontological concept is fine, but in its implementation is not.  We may want to think about creating a local predicate. | 
| Primary Date | primary_date | ::RDF::Vocab::DC11.date | string | multiple | A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource. | The date that the end-user expects for the object. | `Primary Date:` 1869.| Tisch Library maps this from the `MARC 264 $c` field, and the Excel `Date` field, the Proquest `.//DISS_comp_date` and the Springer `.//OnlineDate/Year`| 
| Provenance | provenance | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.provenance | string | multiple | A statement of any changes in ownership and custody of the resource since its creation that are significant for its authenticity, integrity, and interpretation. | | | |
| Publisher | publisher | ::RDF::Vocab::DC11.publisher | string | multiple | An entity responsible for making the resource available. | Examples of a Publisher include a person, an organization, or a service. Note: digital collections may consist of digitized versions of published materials in which you may want to include information on the original publisher and the publisher of the digitized content. Remember in AACR2, everything on the internet is considered published for cataloging purposes, and the institution making the records available on line may be considered a publisher. Always omit the place of publication. The element is for the entity only. Use the source element if you feel it is necessary to record greater detail about the manifestation. (Source: Original postcard publication: Chicago, Illinois: Acmegraph Co., 1955.) | `Publisher:` Tufts University. Tisch Library. | In practice this has always been *Tufts University. Tisch Library.*|
| QR Note | qr_note | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.qr_note | string | multiple | Part of the administrative element set. A free text field to be filled out between the metadata author and review for clarification of issues | | | In practice this field has almost never been used.|
| QR Rejection Reason | rejection_reason | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.rejection_reason | string | multiple | | | | |
| QR Status | qr_status | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.qr_status | string | multiple | | | | |
| Replaces | replaces | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.replaces | string | multiple | | | | |
| Retention Period | retention_period | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.retention_period | string | multiple | | | | |
| Rights | rights_statement | ::RDF::Vocab::EDM.rights | [controlled](../config/authorities/rights_statements.yml) | `singluar` | | | | |
| Rights Holder | rights_holder | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.rightsHolder | string | multiple | | | | |
| Rights Note | rights_note | ::RDF::Vocab::DC11.rights | string | `singular` | | | | |
| Source | source | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.source | string | multiple | A related resource from which the described resource is derived. | Tisch interprets this in line with OCLC that it is the original object which the digital surrogate represents.  DCA interprets this as an isPartOf relationship to a collection. | `Source:` Print version: North American Conference on Common Loon Research and Management(2nd : 1979 : Syracuse, N.Y.). Proceedings of the Second North American Conference on Common Loon Research and Management, January 14-16, 1979, Syracuse, New York. [New York]: The Society ; Meredith : Request copies from Loon Preservation Committee, Audubon Society of N.H., ©1979 (DLC) 79117470 (OCoLC)5776147 |  Think of this as an isFormatOf relationship.  Tisch maps this for digitized books only. |
| Spatial | geographic_name | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.spatial | string | multiple |  Used to describe the spatial characteristics of the resource. | Use the TGN for formulating. |`Spatial:` Mexico City (inhabited place) | Tisch has traditionally interpreted this as an equivalent to a 651 in MARC.  The issues is that now that it sits as a dc:spatial, to be true to the implementation it should not be a precordinated string.  If we use dc:spatial, we need to use Getty http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html and remove strings, ie. we have legacy data in precordinated strings, and now we need to either decide to keep and move to a local predicate, or just validate against the TGN. |
| Start Date | admin_start_date | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.start_date | string | multiple | | | | |
| Steward | steward | ::Tufts::Vocab::Terms.steward | string | `singluar` | An internal, and local, general note that indicates the steward of the object | Use lowercase for these fields. | `Steward:`tisch | This field is populated automatically through the RepoToolKit, but must be hand entered if using the MIRA editor for single item ingest.|
| Subject | subject | ::RDF::Vocab::DC11.subject | string | multiple | The topic of the resource. | Use Library of Congress in formulating headings.  Prefer short strings found in [id.loc.gov](https:\\id.loc.gov) to overly long precordinated ones.| `Subject:`Almanacs, American--Massachusetts.| For Tisch created content, this is mapped from the following: the `MARC 650` field, and the `Subject` column for an Excel based ingest. Note: Catalogers provide subject analysis using the MIRA editor for Proquest and Springer.|
| Table of Contents | table_of_contents | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.tableOfContents | string | multiple | A structured list of the contents of a resource. | A refinement of `Description` | `Table of Contents:`| |
| Temporal | temporal | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.temporal | string | multiple | Temporal characteristics of the resource. | Dates in the DC Coverage Temporal apply to the subject content of the resource, that is when the resource is significantly about a particular date, or time period, or an image depicts a person, place or thing on a particular date, and that the temporal aspect is judged significant for a users identification and retrival needs. | `Temporal:`16th century. | Tisch has traditionally used this as a subject aboutness statement.  It is only mapped in Excel based ingest for Trove in the `Century` column. |
| Title | title | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.title | string | `singluar` |A name given to the resource by which it will be formally known and is descriptive of the intellectual object. | Use the appropriate content standard in formulating, such as: RDA, DCRM(b), CCO. |`title:` The Atlantic Almanac. |For Tisch created content, this is mapped from the following: the `MARC 245` field, the Proquest `//DISS_title" name="title`, the Springer `//ArticleTitle` element, and the `Title` column for an Excel based ingest.  |
| Tufts License | tufts_license | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.license | string | `singluar` | | | | |
| Type | resource_type | ::RDF::Vocab::DC.type | [controlled](../config/authorities/resource_types.yml) | `singular` | | | | |
| Visiblity | *n/a* | Uses Hydra Access Controls | [controlled](https://github.com/curationexperts/epigaea/wiki/MIRA-XML-Import-Export-Format#valid-values-for-metadata-fields) | *n/a*  | | | | |

## System Dates
`Ingested` and `Modified` are both managed by the application and cannot be directly modified via the UI 
or importers.  `Ingested` represents the date that the work was initially created in the repository. 
`Modified` reflects the date the work was last updated via the UI or system process (import, template update, etc.).
